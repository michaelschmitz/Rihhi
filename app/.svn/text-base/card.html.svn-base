				<h2>Extraction Inc.</h2>
				<p>Huge corporations have replaced the fallen states of the early 21th century. Megacities have succumbed under tens of millions of slumdwellers,
				and within their lawless zones the competing corporations hire mercenaries to infiltrate, sabotage or outright execute their competitors. </p>
				<p>These mercenaries range from hopeful new arrivals armed with rusty pistols to highly trained, cybernetically enhanced agents who have
				 access to incredible levels of firepower. </p>
				<p>These cybernetically enhanced agents are among the most powerful beings alive. </p>
				<p>Dealing with corporate security guards, former military troops and armored vehicles barely demands their attention. Tanks are handled before breakfast. 
				Only other agents represent a credible threat.</p>
				<p>City blocks are leveled whenever two of these agents clash, and their battles become legends among the shaken survivors in the slums.</p>
				<p>You belong to one of the many hopefuls living within the sprawl and  peddle your services to anyone interested. And you have just received your first offer for a real contract...</p>
				<p> If you want to succeed in this hard new world, then this is your chance.</p>

				<h2>Gameplay</h2>
				<p>The game is divided in two parts: Mission Preparation and Mission Execution.</p>				
				<p>Mission preparation includes new mission selection, preparation and upgrading of your cyborg agents and investments
					into research and additional equipment. This requires level-headed thinking and a strategic outlook.</p>
				<p>Mission execution places the agents inside the city and on a direct path to their target. Agents have to deal with civillians,
					police and enemy security as well as other agents if necessary. This involves excessive use of force and 
					a clear tactical mindset.
			</div>
			
						
			<div id="Missions">
				<h2>Missions:</h2>
				<p>There are 45 basic interchangeable missions and 5 unique ones. </p>
				<p>Unique missions are intended to finish a game session at levels 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 and provide cliffhangers to the overall backstory.</p>
				<p>Basic missions are always for a certain difficulty level, with 3 missions each for difficulty levels one, two, three up to fifteen.</p>
				<p>At the start of the game, players can view the three Level 1 - Missions and select one to start with. </p>
				<p>Once they have completed one mission of level 1, they can randomly draw one new level 2 mission and continue with it.<p>
				<p>Players may also choose to continue with another level 1 mission to see another level 2 mission to choose and gain more cash, research and equipment.</p>
				<p>So once a mission becomes available for a player group, they can choose to finish them at any later time - no strict order required.</p>	
				<p>See the page <a href="missions.html">Missions</a> for a listing of all missions available</p>

				<h2>Tactics Cards:</h2>
				<p>Players can buy tactics cards for their cyborgs. They allow the cyborgs to behave in a certain manner advantageous to the current situation and normally provide a massive boost to a teammember.</p>

				<p>Equipment cards represent hardware, Tactics cards software. Tactic cards allow the cyborgs to take cover, switch places with other cyborgs, provide cover fire,
