				<h2>Missions:</h2>
				<p>There are 42 basic interchangeable missions and 8 unique ones. </p>
				<p>Unique missions are intended to finish a game session at levels 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 and provide cliffhangers to the overall backstory.</p>
				<p>Additional unique missions are placed at levels 1, 7 and 14. They are intended to push the story forward.</p>
				<p>Basic missions are always for a certain difficulty level, with 3 missions each for difficulty levels one, two, three up to fifteen.</p>
				<p>At the start of the game, players can view the three Level 1 - Missions and select one to start with. </p>
				<p>Once they have completed one mission of level 1, they can randomly draw one new level 2 mission and continue with it.<p>
				<p>Players may also choose to continue with another level 1 mission to see another level 2 mission to choose and gain more cash, research and equipment.</p>
				<p>Once a mission becomes available for a player group, they can choose to finish them at any later time - no strict order required.</p>	
				<p>An exception to this rule are the unique missions - they need to be completed for the players to advance.</p>				
				<hr>
				<p>Difficulty of missions varies according to the level the mission is on and the number of players.</p>
				<p>If there are more players for a given mission, then the number of enemies is increased, as well as the cash for successful completion.</p>
				<p>Missions vary in difficulty for each level according to their names: "A" missions are easy, "B" levels challenging and "C" levels hard.</p>
				<p>Equipment given to the enemies depends solely on the level of the mission, not on the number of players.</p>
				<p>Enemies roll for their equipment, if a Security rolls 6 for an Uzi but there are none left in the stack, then he will get the next lower result weapon.</p>
				<p>If the level of the mission is higher, then the enemies are using their advanced stats as given on their cards (for 1-5, 6-10,11-15)</p>
